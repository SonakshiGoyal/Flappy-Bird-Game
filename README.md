# Flappy-Bird-Game
Flappy Bird was a side-scrolling game developed by Dong Nguyen. 
The aim of the game is simple, try to fly the bird, which is called “Faby”, between the green pipes without hitting them. Flappy Bird is a mobile game in which the player controls a bird's flight to refrain from colliding with obstacles. 
Tapping the keys for a longer period of time allows the bird to fly higher while letting go causes the bird to fall down. The flappy bird game will render an image of a bird flying through an environment and display the flapping motion of the wings according to the player's ability to tap the relevant keys. 
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes, which are equally sized gaps placed at random heights, without coming into contact them.
Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. If the player touches the pipes, it ends the game. 
The bird briefly flaps upward each time the player taps the key. If the key is not tapped, the bird falls due to gravity.
